## What is it?

An easily accessible use-case repository for users with different background, based on the use-case methodology defined in the standard IEC 62559-2:2015.
- So far, three formats to describe use cases are supported: Markdown documents, Excel sheets, and XML files.
- The solution is built in a modular way, so support for new use case formats can be added without changing the existing setup.
- Use case files are uploaded to certain repositories, where some logic will be triggered to process them.
- Then, the final files are be ready to be displayed in a web-based visualization.
