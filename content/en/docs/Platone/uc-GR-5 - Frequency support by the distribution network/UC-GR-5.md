## 1.3. Scope and Objectives of Use Case

*Scope and objectives of use case*
|||
| --- | --- |
| Scope | The scope of the UC is to examine the operational use of flexibility tools in order to satisfy that line and voltage limits of the distribution network are not violated in the case of a frequency support request by the transmission system. More in detail, customers with flexible loads will respond to such requests and the DSO will use flexibility tools to coordinate their response aiming at achieving the frequency support objective while ensuring distribution network operational safety. As in the previous Use Cases the state of the system is provided by the state estimation tool. <br/> Network: MV <br/> Markets: Near Real Time|
| **Objective(s)** | To keep the distribution network within physical limits (line and voltage) with appropriate actions in the case of a frequency restoration reserve activation request by the TSO.|
| **Related business case(s)** |add text|

***Notes:***
* **Scope** - describes the aims and boundaries of the use case in a short, precise text.
* **Objective(s)** - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline.
* **Realted business case(s)** - optional

## 1.4. Narrative of Use Case


**Short description**
Customers with flexible loads are connected to the distribution network and their loads are considered aggregated for the scope of the UCs regarding their management in the MV level. State of the network is known with a good degree of certainty based on the available measurements and the topology via the AMR, GIS and SCADA data. A frequency support activation request from the TSO arrives at the customers with flexible loads. The request is also communicated to the DSO technical platform via an API and the information is shared with the appropriate tools and services. The DSO calculated and communicated to the customers the appropriate network tariffs that reflect the situation of the network. The flexible loads react to these tariffs and respond to the frequency support request appropriately

## 1.6. Use case conditions

|Assumptions| Prerequisites|
|-----------|-------------|
|Customers' consent required for participation in the flexibility mechanism| DSO systems (e.g.AMR, GIS, SCADA) being operational|
Simulation of TSO
***Notes:***
* **Assumptions** - general presumptions about conditions or system configurations (e.g. customer's consent required for some steps; simulation of TSO)
* **Prerequisites** - specify which requirements have to be met so that the basis scenario use case can be successfully accomplished.

***Notes:***
* **Relation to other use cases** - relation to other use cases in the same project or thematic area. Possible relation types are for instance include, extend, invoke, or associate.
* **Level of depth** - reflects the degree of specialisation of the use case. Although no common notation is settled, descriptions like high level use case, generic, detailed, or specialised use case are often used.
* **Prioritisation** - helps to rate the use cases in a project from very important to nice-to-have with labels like obligatory/mandatory or optional which have to be agreed upon beforehand.
* **Generic, regional or national relation** - for the purpose of generalisation if use case is applied to areas where restictions by law or silimiar issues occur.
* **Nature of the use cases** - describes the viewpoint and field of attention like *technical, political, business/market, test*, etc.

***Notes***
This part describes the possible scenarios of the use case. The scenarios should comply with the sequence diagrams in Sect. 2 of the template, so that every step describes one part of a communication or action. Apart from a normal success scenario, different failure scenarios or alternatives can be included to describe situations where preconditions are not satisfied or unwanted states are attained.
* **Primary Actor** - the first actor appearing in the scenario at the incident causing the scenario to begin.
* **Triggering Event** - the incident causing the scenario to begin.
* **Pre-Condition** - indicates which terms have to be fulfilled for the scenario to be executed.
* **Post-Condition** - indicates which terms should be valid after the scenario. TIt can also specify whether a scenario has been successfully completed or not.
