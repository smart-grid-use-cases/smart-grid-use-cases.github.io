| --- | --- |
| Scope | The scope of the UC is the integration of measurement data obtained from PMUs into the state estimation tool.<br/> Network: MV<br/> Markets: Near Real Time|
| **Objective(s)** | * To reinforce network observability and controllability via improved state estimation performance.<br/> * To ensure smooth incorporation of synchronised measurement data derived from PMUs into the preexisting system of conventional measurements.|

***Notes:***
* **Scope** - describes the aims and boundaries of the use case in a short, precise text.
* **Objective(s)** - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline.
* **Realted business case(s)** - optional

## 1.4. Narrative of Use Case


**Short description**
A measurement set, composed of actual and historical measurement data obtained from the dispersed metering devices (AMR, GIS, SCADA, PMUs) installed throughout the network, is available to the DSO for real-time operation purposes. The aforementioned data refer to a) synchronised measurements of bus voltage phasors and line current phasors (magnitude and angle) and b) conventional measurements of power flows and voltage magnitudes at the top of distribution feeders, power injections from distributed generation units, and load pseudo-measurements for aggregated consumer demand at MV/LV transformer level. Given that the network model (topology) is known with a good degree of certainty, the state estimation tool ensures that the network is observable based on the available measurement set, reconciles the PMU data with the conventional measurements, and, subsequently, calculates the estimated state vector, that is, the voltage magnitudes and angles of all network buses.

***Notes:***
* **Relation to other use cases** - relation to other use cases in the same project or thematic area. Possible relation types are for instance include, extend, invoke, or associate.
* **Level of depth** - reflects the degree of specialisation of the use case. Although no common notation is settled, descriptions like high level use case, generic, detailed, or specialised use case are often used.
* **Prioritisation** - helps to rate the use cases in a project from very important to nice-to-have with labels like obligatory/mandatory or optional which have to be agreed upon beforehand.
* **Generic, regional or national relation** - for the purpose of generalisation if use case is applied to areas where restictions by law or silimiar issues occur.
* **Nature of the use cases** - describes the viewpoint and field of attention like *technical, political, business/market, test*, etc.

***Notes***
This part describes the possible scenarios of the use case. The scenarios should comply with the sequence diagrams in Sect. 2 of the template, so that every step describes one part of a communication or action. Apart from a normal success scenario, different failure scenarios or alternatives can be included to describe situations where preconditions are not satisfied or unwanted states are attained.
* **Primary Actor** - the first actor appearing in the scenario at the incident causing the scenario to begin.
* **Triggering Event** - the incident causing the scenario to begin.
* **Pre-Condition** - indicates which terms have to be fulfilled for the scenario to be executed.
* **Post-Condition** - indicates which terms should be valid after the scenario. TIt can also specify whether a scenario has been successfully completed or not.
