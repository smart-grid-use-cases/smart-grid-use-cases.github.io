## 1.3. Scope and Objectives of Use Case

|||
| --- | --- |
| Scope | The scope of the UC is the investigation of the capability of the state estimation tool to filter the available measurement data, comprising actual measurements obtained from active metering devices and pseudo-measurements, i.e. data derived from load forecasting or RES scheduling for network observability accomplishment, in order to identify measurement with gross errors (bad data), to suppress measurement errors, to reconcile inconsistent data and, ultimately, to estimate the actual operational network state. The goal is to ensure that high quality estimative of the network state will be acquired via the state estimation tool in real-time conditions under various network operating scenarios. The estimated network state will be used as an input to distribution management applications.<br/>|
| **Objective(s)** | The DSO needs to improve confidence in actual measurement data obtained throughout the network as well as available load forecasts in order to capture the real-time operational network state.|

## 1.4. Narrative of Use Case


**Short description**
Fulfillment of network observability and estimation of its real-time state by the State Estimation tool.

**Complete description**
The DSO operates the distribution network. A measurement set, composed of actual and historical measurement data obtained from the dispersed metering devices (AMR, GIS, SCADA) installed throughout the network, is available for real-time operation purposes. The related measurements refer to power flows and voltage magnitudes at the top of distribution feeders, power injections from distributed generation units, and load pseudo-measurements for aggregated consumer demand at MV/LV transformer level. Given that the network model (topology) is known with a good degree of certainty, the state estimation tool ensures that the network is observable based on the available measurement set and, subsequently, calculates the estimated state vector, that is, the voltage magnitudes and angles of all network buses.

***Notes***
This part describes the possible scenarios of the use case. The scenarios should comply with the sequence diagrams in Sect. 2 of the template, so that every step describes one part of a communication or action. Apart from a normal success scenario, different failure scenarios or alternatives can be included to describe situations where preconditions are not satisfied or unwanted states are attained.
* **Primary Actor** - the first actor appearing in the scenario at the incident causing the scenario to begin.
* **Triggering Event** - the incident causing the scenario to begin.
* **Pre-Condition** - indicates which terms have to be fulfilled for the scenario to be executed.
* **Post-Condition** - indicates which terms should be valid after the scenario. TIt can also specify whether a scenario has been successfully completed or not.
